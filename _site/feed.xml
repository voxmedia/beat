It’s an opportunity to reflect, engage, explore, inspire and connect. Using workshops, games, conversations and storytelling to strengthen our relationships and share our knowledge. It only works if we all work. We get out of it what we put into it. This isn’t a conference. It isn’t a summit. This is a chance to take a BEAT.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">Submit an idea</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/submit-an-idea.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Submit an idea" /><published>2017-10-06T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-10-06T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/submit-an-idea</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/submit-an-idea.html">&lt;div style=&quot;height: 10vw;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Ideas submissions are due Thursday 1/31 and you’ll receive an email letting you know if your idea was accepted by Monday 2/4.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;To access the Trello Board, click &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://trello.com/invite/b/OrOxXDIx/896dd492378444b9b606ad2133494262/beat-2019-planning-board&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You may need to hit “join board” in order to edit it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you need access to Trello, please dm Ashley Twaddell.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;How to submit an idea&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Trello planning board is divided into multiple lists. Each list is a different format of content. Their definitions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Workshops:&lt;/b&gt; Workshops should be design with an activity in mind. Your participants will walk away having learned a new skill and somehow trying on that skill, either by making something, walking through a program step-by-step, completing a worksheet, role-playing, you name it! [Workshops are either 1hr or 1hr15min.]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Huddles:&lt;/b&gt; Huddles are just a fun word for discussions. Unlike workshops, these conversations might not have a hands on activity or a super-specific goal. They might just be a space to talk and connect around a topic of interest to a specific group. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lightning talks:&lt;/b&gt; Lightning talks (or storytime!) are short presentations that are given to the entire group. We usually stack a few back to back and space them throughout the program. Lightning talks can be on any topic and can be shown with or without slides. [Lightning talks are either 3min, 5min, or 10min]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guided conversations:&lt;/b&gt; The idea behind guided conversations is to create space for any complex conversations you may have needed to have as a team about something work related, team health related or about the company or industry. Ideally,  at the end of a guided conversation, the group will walk away with 1 or 2 action items to improve or implement the idea in a decided timeframe. The leader will be responsible for seeing this through. Leadership will prepare some of their own ideas for conversations, but welcome you to provide topics of interest as well.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;+1s:&lt;/b&gt; Plus ones are outside speakers from the industry. We can invite them in to lead a workshop or give a keynote talk. Ashley will reach out and hopefully a guest or two will be available!  &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Activities:&lt;/b&gt; Activities are events you organize. e.g. a morning run or some late night board games. Upvote your favorites and add yourself to the card if you’d like to join any of them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Backboard:&lt;/b&gt; The backboard is where you can suggest an idea that you either can’t or do not wish to run. If you look at the list and see a card that you think you can be the owner of, pick it up and  move it over to the respective list it belongs in and mark yourself as the owner.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;One other feature that  I’ve added to the board this year is the ability to up-vote. If you like someone’s idea, instead of adding yourself to the card like we did last year, simply  give it a vote. This will help me see where interest lies across our programs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;How is the final schedule chosen?&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After the cut off date for idea submission ends, Ashley goes into the board and categorizes all the information. She looks at the subject matter of the idea, who the audience is, the length of the program, who is running it and what the outcomes will be. Now she’ll also be able to see how much interest there is with the voting tool. At the end, her goal is to organize a well-rounded event that offers a lot of diverse and valuable programming. She also carefully looks at how the sessions fit together -- e.g. don’t run all of the engineering topics in one session. At the very end she drops it all into a black hat and taps it with a black wand and ABRACADABRA...BEAT is born!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you  have any questions about  your ideas or need help shaping them, reach out to Ashley directly or feel free to use the #beat-2019 slack channel to get feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;At its core, BEAT is an “unconference” in the sense that the content is decided by the participants. Topics may include industry related information, skill-building, and culture sharing. Formats include workshops, small conversations and storytelling/lightning talks. Additionally we’ll have some conversation from leadership and open office hours that you can book. We also want to welcome outside guest speakers, called “+1s”, to provide keynote speeches or workshops on topics you pick.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;View our Quick Facts section to source basic information about the event. To learn more about how you play a role in the event, check out our participant guide. If questions come up, see if they’re answered in the FAQs, otherwise @Ashley.Twaddell via DM in slack or in the #beat2019 slack channel.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;break id=&quot;part_guide&quot;&gt;&lt;/break&gt;

  &lt;h2 class=&quot;ul&quot;&gt;Participant Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BEAT is all about bringing your whole self to connect with and learn from your peers and partners. It’s a great opportunity to meet teammates face-to-face and introduce yourself and what you do to people you’ve never met.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;BEAT is also a great opportunity to practice your presentation and workshop facilitation skills. Sharing knowledge is an important skill no matter what team you’re on or what your role is and preparing a talk, workshop or activity is a great way to hone that skill in a very welcoming space! You can even sign up to co-host something!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Even if you don’t present, we hope that you show up in an engaged way at BEAT. We want you to play full out, voice your opinions, ask for help as you’re learning something and offer help to anyone that needs it. We’ve intentionally designed an environment for learning and sharing that is: open-minded, respectful, inclusive and ideal for trying and experiencing new things. If you’re slightly uncomfortable, but still willing, we’ll know we’ve planned this right.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Practically speaking, to participate in BEAT you’ll need to complete the items on the high-level planning schedule listed below. Even if you don’t plan to submit an idea, please vote on submissions or offer up topics on the Guided Conversations/+1s list or Backboard list. When it comes time for the event, it follows a “choose your own adventure” format; you’ll head to whatever session is of interest to you at that time. You can either follow a specific track e.g. a designer attending all design presentations OR you can mix and match; go to some skillshares, some non-work related workshops or attend a program outside your discipline to learn more about it. The choice is yours!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;High-Level Planning Schedule&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Communications up to and during the event&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Major communication announcements will be sent via email to the pdt email listserv and cross-posted in the #beat-announce slack channel. During the event, #beat-announce will be the main communication channel for any all-participant notifications and organizing information. Two other slack channels will be used during the event:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;#beat-2019&lt;/b&gt;: primary chit chat channel&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;#beat-social&lt;/b&gt;: to plan anything self-organized outside of BEAT programming&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;break id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;&lt;/break&gt;

  &lt;h2 class=&quot;ul&quot;&gt;FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;Is BEAT mandatory?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While BEAT is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged. Trust us, the FOMO will be real, so we hope you’ll plan to join us!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Who comes to BEAT?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;All members of the product, design and technology groups are invited to BEAT in addition to some operations team folks who work closely with Chorus. If you have questions about someone’s participation, reach out directly to Ashley to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;What type of workshops or talks are given at BEAT?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We encourage diverse programming! Since BEAT is set up to be a “choose your own adventure” style conference, we like to mix up the workshop and talk topics. We like to see deep work topics, beginner and advanced skills programming, interdisciplinary round-table conversations, and programs beyond work related topics. Check out last year’s schedule &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TXB71Np0bz-jvE77M0yh2imO6VLsxYNCpMyF6IeOERY/edit&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;If I’m based in the DC area, do I have to stay at the hotel?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nope! Please feel free to commute to and from the hotel as if it’s a day conference. We can cover a taxi ride home should you decide to stay late for the team dinner on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Do I have to “contribute” to BEAT? What if I don’t have anything to share or get anxiety speaking to large groups?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Whether you believe us or not, you definitely have something to contribute or you wouldn’t be here! Everyone on our team has unique talents and interests or things that you’re learning more about and want to share! We won’t have time to hear from everyone, however, we encourage you to at least apply. Additionally, if you’re a little shy, you could also propose a post-dinner activity like a board game you love. Even if you don’t host something, attitude is everything; plan to come as an active and engaged participant in whatever way that means for you!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Will the content be recorded?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can’t guarantee that all content will be recorded. We don’t currently have the means to set up recording in every breakout space due to cost and resource constraints. We will, however, keep an archive folder of presentations and notes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;Are there breaks at BEAT?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes. We have a few breaks scattered throughout each day’s programming to help balance the amount of programming offered.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;break&gt;&lt;/break&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
