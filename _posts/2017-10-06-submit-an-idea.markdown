  <h2>How to submit an idea</h2>
  <p>The Trello planning board is divided into multiple lists. Each list is a different format of content. Their definitions are as follows:</p>

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Workshops:</b> Workshops should be designed with an activity in mind. Your participants will walk away having learned a new skill and somehow trying on that skill, either by making something, walking through a program step-by-step, completing a worksheet, role-playing, you name it! [Workshops are either 1hr or 1hr15min.]</li>
    <li><b>Huddles:</b> Huddles are just a fun word for discussions. Unlike workshops, these conversations might not have a hands on activity or a super-specific goal. They might just be a space to talk and connect around a topic of interest to a specific group. </li>
    <li><b>Lightning talks:</b> Lightning talks (or storytime!) are short presentations that are given to the entire group. We usually stack a few back to back and space them throughout the program. Lightning talks can be on any topic and can be shown with or without slides. [Lightning talks are either 3min, 5min, or 10min]</li>
    <li><b>Guided conversations:</b> The idea behind guided conversations is to create space for any complex conversations you may have needed to have as a team about something work related, team health related or about the company or industry. Ideally,  at the end of a guided conversation, the group will walk away with 1 or 2 action items to improve or implement the idea in a decided timeframe. The leader will be responsible for seeing this through. Leadership will prepare some of their own ideas for conversations, but welcome you to provide topics of interest as well.</li>
    <li><b>+1s:</b> Plus ones are outside speakers from the industry. We can invite them in to lead a workshop or give a keynote talk. Ashley will reach out and hopefully a guest or two will be available!  </li>
    <li><b>Activities:</b> Activities are events you organize. e.g. a morning run or some late night board games. Upvote your favorites and add yourself to the card if you’d like to join any of them.</li>
    <li><b>Backboard:</b> The backboard is where you can suggest an idea that you either can’t or do not wish to run. If you look at the list and see a card that you think you can be the owner of, pick it up and  move it over to the respective list it belongs in and mark yourself as the owner.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>One other feature that  I’ve added to the board this year is the ability to up-vote. If you like someone’s idea, instead of adding yourself to the card like we did last year, simply  give it a vote. This will help me see where interest lies across our programs.</p>

  <h2>How is the final schedule chosen?</h2>

  <p>After the cut off date for idea submission ends, Ashley goes into the board and categorizes all the information. She looks at the subject matter of the idea, who the audience is, the length of the program, who is running it and what the outcomes will be. Now she’ll also be able to see how much interest there is with the voting tool. At the end, her goal is to organize a well-rounded event that offers a lot of diverse and valuable programming. She also carefully looks at how the sessions fit together -- e.g. don’t run all of the engineering topics in one session. At the very end she drops it all into a black hat and taps it with a black wand and ABRACADABRA...BEAT is born!</p>

  <p>If you  have any questions about  your ideas or need help shaping them, reach out to Ashley directly or feel free to use the #beat-2019 slack channel to get feedback.</p>
