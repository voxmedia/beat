  <h2>How to submit an idea</h2>
  <p>The Trello planning board is divided into multiple lists. Each list is a different format of content. Their definitions are as follows:</p>

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Workshops:</b> </li>
    <li><b>Lightning talks:</b> </li>
    <li><b>Guided conversations:</b> </li>
    <li><b>+1s:</b> </li>
    <li><b>Activities:</b> </li>
    <li><b>Backboard:</b> </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>One other feature that  I’ve added to the board this year is the ability to up-vote. If you like someone’s idea, instead of adding yourself to the card like we did last year, simply  give it a vote. This will help me see where interest lies across our programs.</p>

  <h2>How is the final schedule chosen?</h2>

  <p>After the cut off date for idea submission ends, Ashley goes into the board and categorizes all the information. She looks at the subject matter of the idea, who the audience is, the length of the program, who is running it and what the outcomes will be. Now she’ll also be able to see how much interest there is with the voting tool. At the end, her goal is to organize a well-rounded event that offers a lot of diverse and valuable programming. She also carefully looks at how the sessions fit together -- e.g. don’t run all of the engineering topics in one session. At the very end she drops it all into a black hat and taps it with a black wand and ABRACADABRA...BEAT is born!</p>

  <p>If you  have any questions about  your ideas or need help shaping them, reach out to Ashley directly or feel free to use the #beat-2019 slack channel to get feedback.</p>
