# What is BEAT
**BEAT** is a celebration of each of us and all of us at once. It’s an opportunity to reflect, engage, explore, inspire and connect. Using workshops, games, conversations and storytelling to strengthen our relationships and share our knowledge. It only works if we all work. We get out of it what we put into it. This isn’t a conference. It isn’t a summit. This is a chance to take a BEAT.

# How this works
Part choose your own adventure, part curated experience; throw it in an inspiring space and you get BEAT. A day and a half of hands-on sensory experiences mixed with inspiring talks from outside guests, stories from team members, one-on-ones with leadership and casual opportunities to connect. We, as a team, will curate the entire agenda together over the next couple of months.

# Timeline
### October/November
1) Make sure you register for the event, book your travel and book your stay at the hotel. Details on that below.

2) Start to think about how you’ll contribute. What do you want to show, share, ask, tell, document, explore, or preserve?

3) Once you’ve thought about it and have an idea (or two or three), use the curate section

Then begin to suggest your contributions to your team? What do you want to show, share, ask, tell, document, explore, or preserve? Once you’ve thought about it, use the Curate section on the site to propose a workshop, sign up for a storytime slot, nominate a +1 guest, or make a “special request”.

By November, a schedule will start to evolve, speakers will be invited, workshop hosts will be notified, and the site will be updated.
