### Meals at BEAT
All meals will be catered by the Line Hotel and will incorporate dietary requests and preferences. The food and beverage programs are run by Spike Gjerde, Corey Polyoka, Todd Thrasher and  Erik Bruner-Yang. I think weâ€™ll eat and drink okay.

We will have a team dinner on Thursday evening that will finish by 9pm.
